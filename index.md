### Welcome!

Welcome to my github page! Heres a little about myself...

My name is Orlando J. Carcamo. I am 17 and currently attend Del Norte High School in pursuit of a carrer in computer science and computer engineering specifically devops engineering. I have keen interests for managing backends running on servers, working with WebSockets, and overall just exploring the infinite capabilities possible with code.
