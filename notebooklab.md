| Week 0 | CSA - Tools and Equipment | [Hacks]() | We started our journey in CSA by creating a new Github Pages. The hardest part for me was making the design look right because it appeared strange and was locked to the left side of the page. I also added my own styling and calculator to my page as of hacks. For my calculator I used some old code but added new functionality such as decimals, square root, exponential, and a clear button. I struggled a lot with the technical side of things but after trying many different things and learning from mistakes, I fixed these problems and got everything up on github pages. |
