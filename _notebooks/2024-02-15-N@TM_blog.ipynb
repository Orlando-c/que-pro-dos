    "\n",
    "### We got a lot of feedback and data from parents, students, and even teachers! Here are some of the most common things we heard and how we'll tackle them!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The screen flashes a lot and the messages arent real time!\n",
    "    - We plan to tackle this by using SocketIo or IAM to create real itme updating. This works by listening to a server and getting a response whenever a change is made and it will dynamically update the page rather than forcefully refreshing every single time (thanks for the feedback Mr. Lopez)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Can you create an account?\n",
    "    - No, currently the ability to create an account isnt functional however this is something we hope to achieve whith the next rendition of Place and you'll be able to make even more customization features such as setting a visible name and having your real name, profile pictures, and account security changes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The website looks a bit bland, can you customize anything?\n",
    "    - Yes, currently you can customize the background, text color, and dark/light mode for static parts of the website but we plan on adding a ton more custmization features and not just the frontend ones, the backend ones too!\n",

    "### I feel like as a team we achieved a lot and communicated but I do have my own comments to make:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Akshat\n",
    "    - I feel like Akshat and I worked really well when we made the channels and message api. We worked on our parts individually then came together to make our part of the project which is what the goal of working this trimester was all about, creating our indiviual parts and coming together although I feel like some of our teammates didn't put enough effort or didnt communicate as well as Akshat or I did.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shreyas\n",
    "    - I like that shreyas did make an attempt to work on his feature however we had to scrap it because of its complexity and because it was incomplete, eventually we are planning to bring back the friend messaging feature and use our new knowledge to even further advance it than it previously was\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shivansh\n",
    "    - Shivansh was also a hard worker but he didnt really communicate well with the team or what he was done with/working on as well as his code wasn't his original and made no efforts to change it\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mati\n",
    "    - Mati didnt really complete his feature but did help with frontend aspects and did make an attempt with the part he wa supposed to complete\n",
