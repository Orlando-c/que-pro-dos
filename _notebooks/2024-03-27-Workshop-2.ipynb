    "\n",
    "(a) Explain how a constructor works, including when it runs and what generally is done within a constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. It has the same name as the class and doesn’t have a return type. The purpose of a constructor is to initialize the object’s state. In other words, constructors are used to set initial values for class attributes or to perform any other start-up procedures required for creating a fully formed object.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Create an example of an overloaded constructor within a class. You must use at least three variables. Include the correct initialization of variables and correct headers for the constructor. Then, run the constructor at least twice with different variables and demonstrate that these two objects called different constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overloaded constructors are multiple constructors within the same class that have the same name but different parameters. They provide flexibility in the instantiation of objects by allowing different ways to create an object of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of a class with overloaded constructors:"
