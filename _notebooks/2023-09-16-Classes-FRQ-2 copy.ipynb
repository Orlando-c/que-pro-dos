    "2. Importance of Classes in Java:\n",
    "Classes are fundamental to Java’s object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. They are important for several reasons:\n",
    "Encapsulation: Classes allow us to bundle variables (attributes) and methods (behaviors) together into a single unit, an object. This makes it easier to manage and organize code.\n",
    "Abstraction: Classes provide a way to hide the complex implementation details and expose only the necessary functionalities.\n",
    "Inheritance: Classes enable the creation of hierarchical structures by allowing one class to inherit the properties and methods of another.\n",
    "Polymorphism: Classes allow objects of different types to be treated as objects of a parent class, leading to more flexible and dynamic code.\n",
