    "- I can't believe how much I've learned and grown in my understanding of Java this trimester. When I first started, I didn't even know the difference between Java and JavaScript. But now, I can (somewhat) confidently read and read the language. It's amazing how similar it is to the pseudocode used in last year's AP Computer Science Principles exam, which I am familiar with. By pushing myself to work on the backend and use Java more, I have gained a much deeper understanding of the language. Our project this trimester allowed me to practice my Java skills individually and I feel that continuing to challenge myself in the next two trimesters will prepare me well for the AP Exam and potentially help me achieve a top score of 5.\n",

    "- N@TM offers a diverse range of classes that cater to different interests and skillsets. Among these classes, 3D Animation stands out as a fascinating and visually engaging subject. The art forms showcased in this class were incredibly varied, ranging from realistic depictions to abstract representations, and even a combination of both. Exploring the endless possibilities of 3D animation was an enriching experience, and I found myself fascinated by the intricate details that went into creating each piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another class that I found myself thoroughly immersed in was Visual Arts. It was undoubtedly the class where I spent the most time, aside from Computer Science. The artwork showcased here was truly impressive, and I was awed by the creativity and talent of the artists. This section inspired me to be more thoughtful and deliberate in my own work, as I saw firsthand how attention to detail and a creative mindset could produce stunning results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Of course, I couldn't forget the incredible computer science projects that other students had created. DADY Accademy was one of my personal favorites, as it presented random computer science questions for the user to solve. The project was polished and well-executed, with custom animations and the ability to create an account. It was evident that a lot of hard work and dedication went into creating these projects, and I was inspired to approach my own work with the same level of care and precision. Overall, N@TM provided a rich learning experience, with a diverse range of classes and projects that catered to various interests and skillsets.\n",

    "\n",
    "- We experienced a series of problems especially because we were trying to achieve a lot. This involved creating databasess and api controllers as well as using external apis. We also ran into issues such as frontend aspects of things such as trying to achieve a clothing simulation where you could simulate yourself wearing clothes based on the weather outside. I myself faced a lot of problems with user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- My Major Problems \n",
    "1. I spent a significant amount of time investigating the JWT error, only to discover that it wasn't crucial to the overall issue. Moving forward, I will exercise greater caution by carefully reading the error message and adopting a more focused approach to problem-solving, rather than solely searching for any code-related connections to the error. Moreover, I will overcome any hesitation and seek assistance when faced with challenges like this.\n",
    "2. POST Request error: I had not yet fully looked at Person.java, PersonJpaRepository.java, PersonApiController.java, or the spring security files which led me to taking an excruciating amount of time understanding and finally being able to get a read and post requests. This also led to me getting errors with jwt which I was able to figure out\n",
    "3. CORs error: This was the error that I got stuck on for the longest. After researching it, CORs is a security protocol to protect users from cyberattacks. I eventually figured out I had to configure CORs inside the security file in spring. (Colin and Soham helped me figure this out because they were interacting with systems similar to Person.java and spring security)\n",
