    "# WebSockets\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are WebSockets?\n",
    "\n",
    "WebSockets are a computer communications protocol that provides a full-duplex communication channel over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. Unlike the traditional HTTP protocol, which is unidirectional and stateless, WebSockets allow for bidirectional communication between a client and a server. more specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTTP: Itâ€™s a stateless protocol where each request from the client to the server is independent, and after the server responds, the connection is closed. This means for every new request, a new connection is established.\n",
    "\n",
    "- WebSockets: They create a persistent, two-way communication channel. Once the connection is established through a handshake, it remains open, allowing real-time data exchange without the need to repeatedly refresh the page or make new HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Options\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been looking for options on how to integrate this into my project and I found 2 examples online.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Live Chat Example](https://github.com/Shubh2-0/Chatterbox?tab=readme-ov-file)\n",
    "This one is a very backend focused option which relies heavily on my own system but looks to be functional if I can get it to work on my machine without any issues.\n",
    "![Image](https://github.com/Orlando-c/que-pro-dos/_notebooks/images/chatterbox.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Mort Game Example](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher_portfolio/blob/main/assets/js/platformer2x/Chat.js)\n",
    "This example is from none other than Mr. Mort which is another option I am highly considering if the previous one fails. This one seems to be very frontend focused with what I most likely assume a small backend aspect pertaining to it in order to recieve the messages from the client and display it for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of doing this is to get myself to learn more about websockets while doing something that I enjoy which is coding but also creating something that I did myself that I can hopefully share to others to use in the future. One thing I want to do is adopt PLACE as my own project and implement the things I've learned over the years into that project and make a useable application. Somtheing that I could possible collaborate with Mr. Mortensen on to potentially bring to the CSA classroom as a place (get it lol) that people can also use to collaborate and communicate with teams."
