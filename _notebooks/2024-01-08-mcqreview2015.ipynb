    "### Question 5\n",
    "![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cbb1.png)\n",
    "I selected option C, which is x && y. However, this is not always equivalent to the original expression. Here’s why:\n",
    "- The expression x && y will only be true if both x and y are true.\n",
    "- However, the expression (x || y) && x will be true if x is true, regardless of the value of y.\n",
    "Therefore, the correct answer is option A, which is x, as it always evaluates to the same value as the expression (x || y) && x.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6\n",
    "![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cbc1.png)\n",
    "Option A is marked correct, and it has arguments (“rattrap”, “similar”, “today”). None of these strings contain the substring “art”, so the method correctly returns false.\n",
    "Option B is marked incorrect, and it has arguments (“start”, “article”, “Bart”). Each of these strings contains the substring “art”, so the method correctly returns true.\n",
    "The confusion might arise from the wording of the question. It asks for a method call that does not work as intended. In this case, all the method calls work as intended. The method containsArt correctly identifies whether the substring “art” is present in the concatenated strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 7\n",
    "![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cbd1.png)\n",
    "I selected answer A, but the correct answer is C.\n",
    "The outer loop runs from 1 to 6. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs from the current outer value to 6. If the inner value is even (inner % 2 == 0), it gets printed. After each outer loop iteration, a new line is printed (System.out.println()).\n",
    "So, for the first outer loop iteration (outer = 1), the inner loop prints 2, 4, and 6. For the second iteration (outer = 2), the inner loop prints 2, 4, and 6. For the third iteration (outer = 3), the inner loop prints 4 and 6. This pattern continues until the outer loop ends.\n",
    "Therefore, the correct output is:\n",
    "\n",
    "2 4 6\n",
    "2 4 6\n",
    "4 6\n",
    "4 6\n",
    "6\n",
    "6\n",
    "\n",
    "This matches with answer C in the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 9\n",
    "![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cbe1.png)\n",
    "I selected answer C, but the correct answer is E.\n",
    "- Answer C: ((int)(Math.random()) * 6)+ ((int)(Math.random())*6) This code will always return 0 because (int)(Math.random()) generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), which is always 0 when cast to an integer before multiplying by 6.\n",
    "- Answer E: 2 +((int)(Math.random()*6)) +((int)(Math.random()*6)) This code correctly simulates the roll of two six-sided dice. (int)(Math.random()*6) generates a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and 6 (exclusive). Adding 2 ensures that the result is between 2 (inclusive, as the minimum roll of two dice) and 12 (exclusive, as the maximum roll of two dice).\n",
    "So, the correct code to simulate the roll of two six-sided dice is answer E.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 20\n",
    "![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cbf1.png)\n",
    "You selected answer C, but the correct answer is E.\n",
    "The myMystery method goes through the array arr and counts the number of times each value occurs. It keeps track of the maximum count (m) and the index (index) at which this maximum count occurs. At the end of the method, it returns index.\n",
    "Answer C: “The number of times that the maximum value occurs in nums” is incorrect because the method does not return the count of the maximum value. It returns the index at which the maximum count occurs.\n",
    "Answer E: “An index of a value that occurs most often in nums” is correct. This accurately describes what the method does. It returns the index of the value that occurs most frequently in the array.\n",
    "So, the correct description for the value returned by the call myMystery(nums) is answer E. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 28\n",
    "![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cbg1.png)\n",
    "You selected option C, which states that “Compare values” will execute 15 times and “Assign to temp” will execute 6 times. However, the correct answer is option B, which states that “Compare values” will execute 15 times and “Assign to temp” will execute 5 times.\n",
    "The “Compare values” operation (data[k] < data[m]) is executed in the inner loop for each pair of elements in the array, which is 15 times for an array of size 6.\n",
    "The “Assign to temp” operation (int temp = data[m]) is executed in the outer loop, which iterates one less than the number of elements in the array, which is 5 times for an array of size 6.\n",
    "So, the reason you got this wrong is because the “Assign to temp” operation executes 5 times, not 6, in this specific implementation of the selection sort algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 31\n",
    "![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cba1.png)\n",
    "![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cba2.png)\n",
    "In response to the question, I was tasked with predicting the state of the board after running a specific code segment. I initially selected Option B, believing it to be the correct answer. However, I was mistaken. My error stemmed from a misunderstanding of how the loops and conditions in the code interacted. The correct answer is actually Option E, which necessitates looping over the entire board and alternately checking when rows and columns are even or odd. Hence, Option E is the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 37\n",
    "![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cbh1.png)\n",
    "![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cbh2.png)\n",
    "- Option II: This option starts from the end of the array and concatenates each element until it reaches startIndex. It effectively reverses the order of elements from startIndex to the end of the array. This is why it’s correct.\n",
    "- Option III: This option creates a temporary array to store elements in reverse order and then concatenates them from startIndex. It achieves a similar result as option II but uses an additional array for storage. This is why it’s also correct.\n",
    "Option B, “II only”, is incorrect because it only includes the second option and not the third. The correct answer is option E, “II and III”, because both options II and III provide the correct functionality for the concatWords method. They both ensure that the elements from startIndex to the end of the array are reversed and concatenated into the result string.\n",

    "On this quiz I feel like I could have performed better. 31/39 isnt a great score so there is a lot that I need to improve on. \n",
    "\n",
    "![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cbscore.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- I need to work on objects and arrays (unit 2 and unit 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully working with the backend lessons and working more in the backend will help me get a better understanding for objects and working with data storage types will hopefully help with my knowledge about arrays. Ill also watch the cb videos to make sure I really solidify my understanding of objects and arrays."
