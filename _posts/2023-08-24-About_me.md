description: Learn some things about Orlando Carcamo
---

Hi, I’m Orlando (or Lando xD) and welcome to my blog! I’m a 1st generation American of Latin American descent. I love to explore new places, learn new things, and have fun with my friends.

Some of my hobbies include playing video games, cooking, going to the beach, and hanging out with my friends. I enjoy bashing my head into a wall after loosing a game of DbD or R6S. I also like to cook different dishes, especially from my Latin American cuisine. I find cooking relaxing and rewarding, and I love to share my food with others. Some of my specialties are cilanto-lime rice, fried plantains, flour tortillas, fried chicken, and much more.

Going to the beach is another thing that I love to do. I live in San Diego, California, which has some of the best beaches in the world. I like to swim, walk, or just chill on the sand. The beach is also a great place to hang out with my friends. Music is another thing that vastly interests me. My favorite artists are Lovejoy and Tame Impala, and Vundabar.

Thank you for reading and have a horrible rest of your day. Adios!
